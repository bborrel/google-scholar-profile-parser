Google Scholar Profile Parser is a PHP library which parses the HTML of a scholar's profile page from Google Scholar 
website and transforms its data into a regular PHP data structure.

The parsed data from a scholar is:

- his/her list of publications (title, link, authors, publisher details, citations)
- his/her citations' statistics (number of citations, h-index, i10-index)

## Project Rationale

As explained by this [Wikipedia page][1]:

> Google Scholar is a freely accessible web search engine that indexes the full text or metadata of scholarly literature
> across an array of publishing formats and disciplines.Google Scholar is a website which indexes scholars' publications
> and citations.

Unfortunately [Google Scholar][2] website doesn't provide an API and I needed a way to fetch a scholar's data.

So, while I was looking for a PHP library which parses a profile page from Google Scholar website, I only found 
[Scholar parser][3] from [Daniel Schreij][4]. But I was unhappy with this library's dependency upon [PhantomJS][5] 
which development is suspended (and will likely not resume, leaving users without support). So I decided to rewrite this
library redesigning it to depend only on PHP, and no more Javascript.

## Requirements

As stated in [composer.json][6], it requires:

- PHP 7.1+
- PHP DOM extension

To run this library on PHP 5.6+, install its version 1.x.

## Installation

Use [Composer][7] to download and install this library as well as its dependencies.

```bash
composer require bborrel/google-scholar-profile-parser
```

## Usage

See the examples in the [library's documentation][8].

## Versioning

This library use [SemVer][9] for versioning. For available versions, see the [tags on this repository][10]. For feature
changes, see the [CHANGELOG.md][11] file for details.

## Code Quality

The code of this library:

- follows the [PSR-1][12] and [PSR-12][13] coding standards
- follows the [PSR-4][14] autoloading standard
- is statically analysed with [PHPQA][15] (which wraps several tools, notably [PHPCS][16], [PHPMD][17], [PHPStan][18] 
and [Psalm][19]), and by Code Climate (which is setup with plugins [Phan][20], [PHPMD][17], [SonarPHP][21])
- is unit tested with [PHPUnit][22] (code coverage on [Coveralls][23])
- is mutation tested with [Infection][24]
- is tested for compatibility with different versions of PHP (see [.travis.yml][25] for details)
- has some of its dependencies (those listed by the [PHP Security Advisories Database][26]) checked for known security 
issues
- is continuously integrated on [TravisCI][27]

These tools are installed with the library as long as you do not specify the option `--no-dev` when running the 
`install` or `update` [Composer][7] commands.

To run the static analysis tools and the unit tests via [PHPQA][15]:

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpqa --analyzedDirs=. --ignoredDirs=build,tests,vendor --report
```

To see the reports generated by [PHPQA][15] use a browser to open the file `./build/phpqa.html`.
